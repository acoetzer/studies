                        The very basic building blocks of javascript is known as the primitive types, as seen above in
                        the example list. However before we begin to type javascript in our editors, we will be using
                        the console to quickly demonstrate some javascripts basics. <span
                            class="important">clear()</span> is used to
                        clear the console. When using the console in chrome, we can input some code or command and it
                        will print out the result. This is known as <span class="highlight">REPL</span>, Which stands
                        for, <span class="highlight">Read Evaluate Print Loop</span>.

                    <p>
                        Javascript only has <span class="highlight">one number data type</span>, unlike other
                        programming languages where they have two data types such as <span
                            class="highlight">int(integer) for whole numbers</span> and <span class="highlight">float
                            for decimal numbers</span>. In short, javascript only has 1 type and that includes
                        positive,
                        negative, whole and decimal numbers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reason for ints and floats is that it takes a lot more memory to store those numbers
                        especially if its a decimal number as decimal numbers are considered much larger. Though, in
                        JavaScript numbers do get a certain amount of space in memory, so something like
                        1.999999999999999 will eventually become 2. They are not permitted to continue or to take up
                        an infinite amount of space. there is a hard limit in other words.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the number data type, you have some common math operators that are built into
                        javascript. Looking at the example board above, you see things like addition, subtraction,
                        division
                        all the way to modulos <span class="important">which is mainly used to determine if a number
                            is
                            odd or even, as an example 89089 % 2 //1 (which is considered odd //0 is considered
                            even)</span> and exponents which are represented with <span class="highlight">(**)</span>
                        two astrix symbols.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is however order of operation <span class="highlight">PEMDAS</span> which stands for
                        <span class="important">Parathesis, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition and
                            Subtraction</span>. So something like 3 + 1 * 9 //12, the 1 * 9 which is the
                        multiplication
                        comes before addition. You can change that by placing a parenthesis as so (3 + 1) * 9 //36,
                        so
                        now the numbers within the parenthesis come first.

                                Not a Number
                                <ul>
                                    <li>0/0 = NaN</li>
                                    <li>1 + NaN = NaN</li>
                                    <li>NaN + NaN = NaN</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>typeof</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>
                        NaN is a concept in JavaScript that represents a value that is <span class="highlight">Not a
                            Number</span> but
                        at the same time is considered a numeric value or in other words a number. We can check this
                        with the use of another operator known as <span class="highlight">typeof</span> followed by a
                        single operand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There will be times when you doing something and it will output NaN and this could be due to a
                        value being 0 and you not knowing about it. There could times where user input is with
                        characters and you trying to do math with letters and you receive the results of NaN.

                        <ul>
                            <li>To define a variable:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>let someName = value<span class="important">;</span></li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>To update a variable:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>someName = newValue<span class="important">;</span></li>

                    <p>
                        What is a variable? A variable is like a container that holds a value which is given to it. An
                        example would be <span class="highlight">let numChickens = 4;</span>, this is telling JavaScript
                        that you are, first of all, defining a variable and giving that variable a name with a value. So
                        that, whenever you call upon the variable, it will out put whatever value was given to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is important to note the semi-colon <span class="important">;</span> at the end in
                        JavaScript, In the terminal you don't really need to use it, but when writing a js file, its
                        important to have.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can also update the variable <span class="highlight">someName = someName + newValue</span>,
                        its important to note a distinction here, and that is defining a variable and updating a
                        variable. You will notice when defining a variable, you use something like <span
                            class="important">let</span>. This is telling Javascript of a new variable, hence defining.
                        However, you do not need to define the variable again just to update it, that is because the
                        variable is already there and you just need to refer to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can do math with variables <span class="highlight">numHens <sub>5</sub> + numRoosters
                            <sub>1</sub></span>, refer to video if this doesn't make sense, however each variable has a
                        number value, which would equate to 6 in this instance. You can also, as an example say, <span
                            class="highlight">numHens + 1</span>, you can add a variable and a number together,
                        considering that the variable is a number, otherwise you will end up with a NaN.

                        When it comes to updating variables and more specifically number variables, and working from the
                        above example board, if score was set to 0 and we wanted to add 5 to the score, we can change or
                        update the variable as so <span class="highlight">score = 5;</span>. However you can continue to
                        manually change it. The next possible way to update the varibale is by giving the variable an
                        addition as so <span class="highlight">score = score +5;</span>, so now whenever something
                        happens it will update the score by 5.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another way to do this is by writing a shorter syntax, <span class="highlight">score +=
                            5;</span>, this is the same as the previous example, just much shorter. You can do this for
                        other operators as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, there is another way, though this only increments or decrements the variable by 1
                        <sup>which is quiet common</sup> and that is using what is known as an <span
                            class="highlight">pre/postfix</span> incrementor or decrementor. An example of this would be
                        <span class="highlight">score++ or ++score</span> the same as <span class="highlight">score-- or
                            --score</span>.

                    <h2 id="cv">Const & Var</h2>
                    <div class="example">
                        <ul>
                            <li>const someName = value;</li>
                            <li>var someName = value;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        So we saw that you can define a variable using <span class="highlight">let</span>, however there
                        are two other ways you can define a variable. <span class="highligh">const</span>, which stands
                        for <span class="important">constant</span>. Whatever value you put inside a const, cannot be
                        changed. For now we dont have enough knowledge to explain why something like this would be
                        useful. Though, a small example as to why could be when you know something <span
                            class="important">will not change</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another way is the old way, and that is using <span class="highlight">var</span>, this way still
                        works in javaScripts however should never be used.

                    <div class="example">

                            <li>let isLoggedIn = true;</li>
                            <li>let isLoggedIn = false;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Booleans are fairly straight forward, a boolean is another primitive type, that stores a true or
                        false value. Note that they are written with <span class="highlight">lower case letters</span>,
                        while in other programming languages, they are written with the first letter as capitalized.

                    <p>
                        In JavaScript, variables can change its type from a boolean to a string or numner, unlike other
                        programming languages, where if a variable is set as a boolean, it must remain as a boolean.
                        JavaScript, does have something like TypeScript that enforces these rules, but plain old
                        JavaScript does not.

                    <p>
                        When it comes to Identifiers or naming your variables, it is important to note some hard rules
                        whereby that you cannot start an identifier with a number, nor can you have spaces within your
                        identifier. So something like <span class="important">let some name = false;</span> is not
                        allowed, nor is <span class="important">let 1user = true;</span> is not allowed or permitted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, <span class="highlight">let user1 = value;</span> or <span class="highlight">let
                            username = value;</span> is considered fine. Though, there are some best pratices or
                        convention rules to use when writing identifiers, and those are things like camel or snake
                        casing like so <span class="highlight">let userProfileStatus = value;</span> or <span
                            class="highlight">let user_age = value;</span>. Another good practise to have some sort of
                        meaning in your identifiers and not just 1 letter characters or something like this, <span
                            class="highlight">let isLoggedIn = true;</span>, where you know when you use is in the
                        identifier, it will relate to a boolean type.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also its best to have meaningful variable names, but also not overly long identifiers.
