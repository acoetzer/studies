                    <h2 id="ith">Introduction to HTML</h2>
                    <p>
                        Taking a look at this saying, the <b>Purple Dino Danced</b>. We can break down what HTML is
                        compared to and how to explain what HTML is. HTML is the <b>'what'</b>in this sentence, in
                        otherwords the dino, whereas the purple is css and danced is js. HTML is what is being displayed
                        or viewed, so the in short its the <b>what</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HTML is known as a markup language and stands for <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b>. It is not a
                        full blown programming language with complex logic, It's a way to mark up a document <i>(plain
                            text)</i> and have a way to indicate what is <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i> or what is a <b><a
                                href="https://www.google.com">link</a></b> as an example, through what is known as
                        elements or HTML elements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To write HTML we use what is know as HTML elements, as exmaple:
                    <div class="example">
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>&lt;p&gt;</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><i>This represents the paragraph element</i></li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>&lt;h1&gt;</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><i>This represents the main header on the page</i></li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>&lt;img&gt;</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><i>This embeds an image</i></li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>&lt;form&gt;</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><i>This represents a form</i></li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    These are some of the elements used to write HTML. Although above doesn't illustrate this, but we
                    generally wrap some form of content with what is knowns as &lt;opening tag&gt; and a &lt;/closing
                    tag&gt;.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An example would be something like this &lt;h1&gt;This is a header&lt;/h1&gt; to represent the
                        start and end of the main header. You can also nest tags within elements, using the same example
                        as before, you can make the header bold, like so &lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a header in
                        bold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="pe">Paragraph Elements</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first element we look at is the &lt;p&gt; for paragraph element, and this doesn't mean its
                        only for text purposes, you can have a paragraph for things you wish to group together. That
                        could be a paragraph of images or different pieces of a form. However for now we are only
                        focused on textual paragraphs.
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        The paragraph element has a opening and closing tag to indicate the start and end of said
                        paragraph or group. A paragraph can also contain nested elements such as <b>bold</b>,
                        <i>italics</i> and various other elements in HTML. The paragraph element is a block level
                        element, that take take up there on block.
                    </P>

                    <h3 id="he">Heading Elements</h3>
                    <p>
                        A heading element is a way to provide headings on documents. There are some rules however, each
                        document can only contain 1 &lt;h1&gt; heading, as well as a specific structure to follow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The structure is as follows:
                    <div class="example">
                        <ul>
                            <li>&lt;h1&gt;H1 Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
                                <ul>
                                    <li>&lt;h2&gt;H2 Heading&lt;/h2&gt;
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>&lt;h3&gt;H3 Heading&lt;/h3&gt;
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>
                                                        &lt;h4&gt;H4 Heading&lt;/h4&gt;
                                                    </li>
                                                </ul>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>&lt;h3&gt;H3 Heading&lt;/h3&gt;
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>&lt;h4&gt;H4 Heading&lt;/h4&gt;</li>
                                                </ul>
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    The structure above follows a form of hierarchy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can have multiple h2-h6 headings as illustrated above, though the nested headings should
                        follow the heirarchy form. So never use a &lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt; for only the size, as these
                        headings have a default size and can be changed using css.
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        Just like the paragraph takes up its own space due to it being a block level element, so is the
                        headings element. Anything that comes after the closing tag will be pushed to its own line.
                    </P>

                    <h3 id="hb">HTML Boilerplate</h3>
                    <p>
                        HTML Boilerplate or otherwise known as the HTML Skeleton, is essential to every .html document.
                        The boilerplate follows a structure of a Doctype, html element as well as a head and a body.
                        Here is an example of the essential skeleton needed.
                    <div class="example">
                        <ul>
                            <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</li>
                            <li>&lt;html&gt;
                                <ul>
                                    <li>&lt;head&gt;
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>&lt;/head&gt;</li>
                                    <li>&lt;body&gt;</li>
                                    <li>&lt;/body&gt;</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>&lt;/html&gt;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Starting from the top down,the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; is something of a flag to your browser
                        indicating that this page is using HTML5. This does not need a opening and closing tag. The
                        &lt;html&gt; element or otherwise known as the root element, is the top level element on the
                        document and every other element is a decendant of this element. However there is a rule, you
                        are only allowed 1 head element and one body element.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That brings us to the &lt;head&gt; element. The head element contains things that wont show up
                        on the page, such meta data, information about the web page like &lt;title&gt; and various other
                        things like loading in css or scripts. Just below the head we have the &lt;body&gt; which
                        represents all of the content in out document and it can include any of the elements we have
                        learn't so far.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="le">List Elements</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are 2 kinds of list elements, a &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; un-ordered list or bulleted list and
                        a &lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; ordered list or numbered list. These list elements contain a child
                        element &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;. You can also nested &lt;script&gt; or &lt;template&gt;.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can also nest another list within a list. You can also mix up a ordered list with a
                        un-oreder list.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="at">Anchor Tags</h3>
                    <p>
                        The anchor tag is by far the most crucial element in HTML, as it is used to provide links to
                        other pages, or to jump to a specific heading on a page. The &lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tage is opening
                        and closing but also contains something known as a attribute. An attribute as seen here
                        &lt;ahref="www.google.com"&gt;google&lt;/a&gt; tells the anchor where to go.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will notice the attribute sits inside the tag, while the text being displayed is inbetween
                        the tag. This particular attribute named href, which stands for hypertext reference, will be on
                        every single anchor you make. With anchor tags, you can link to local documents, or a web page.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="i">Images</h3>
                    <p>
                        The &lt;img&gt; element is the first element that does not have an opening or closing tag,
                        however does have attributes to indicatate the source for where to fetch the image being
                        embedded. An example of this would be &lt;img src="/some/location"&gt; or &lt;img
                        src="https://some.co/location"&gt;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The img element can hold further attributes to size the image or alt text as so &lt;img
