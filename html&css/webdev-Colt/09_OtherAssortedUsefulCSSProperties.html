                    <p>
                        When dealing with opacity in css there are 2 options one can use. The first option is a property
                        known as opacity, which ranges from 0 to 1, however the opacity property affects the entire
                        element.
                        Whereas the aplha is a channel within different color value units, as demonstrated above.

                            <li>
                                position: static/relative/absolute/fixed/sticky; <br>
                                top: 50px; <br>

                    <p>
                        Above shows the property position and other properties that control the possitioning once a
                        element
                        has a position value set.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Static</h3>
                    <div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>position: Static;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        An element with a value of static, will remain positioned to the normal flow of the document.
                        The
                        top, right, bottom and left properties will have no affect on this value, as this is the default
                        value.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Relative</h3>
                    <div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>position: relative;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        An element set with a relative position value, is positioned according to the normal flow of the
                        document, however offset by the top, right, bottom and left properties relative to itself.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Absolute</h3>
                    <div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>position: absolute;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The element with the value of absolute is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is
                        created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned to its closest already positioned
                        relative. Otherwise it is relative to it's containing block, in other words the &lt;body&gt;
                        element
                        of the page. The final outcome or position is determined by the top, right, bottom and left
                        properties.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Fixed</h3>
                    <div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>position: fixed;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        An element with the position fixed, works similair to that of absolute. It is removed from the
                        normal flow of the document, however is only relative to the containing block or &lt;body&gt;
                        element. The one difference is the that it will remain in said position given by the top, right,
                        bottom and left properties even when scrolling down and it will remain fixed to an element that
                        also
                        has a scrolling mechanism.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Sticky</h3>
                    <div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>position: sticky</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        A sticky element unlike fixed remains in the flow of the document and is offset in whatever
                        postion
                        it was given by the top, right, bottom and left properties. However sticky will stick to its
                        nearest
                        ancestor that has a scrolling mechanism.

                        </ul>

                    <p>
                        Transitions allow us to transition one property value to another property value. The transition
                        property is a shorthand just like the border shorthand property. Above we can see the other
                        properties associated with transition, you can single them out as well or use the shorthand.
                        Good
                        practise is to layout each property independantly as shown above with color and border-color, so
                        that in the future if you change something it wont get in the way. You can always use the all
                        value
                        to apply the change to all property values.

                    <p>
                        The transform property allows you to translate, rotate and scale elements in css. There is a
                        transform shorthand along with multiple other associates that full under the shorthand. One
                        being
                        the tranform-origin property that allows you to set from an element should be scaled. As seen
                        above.
                        Transform also has multiple properties such as perspective, rotate, scale, translate and skew.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short perspective, changes the perspective of the element. Rotate can rotate an element in
                        3d, or
                        the x,y,z axis. Scale changes the size of an element. Translate moves the positioning of the
                        element
                        and skew skews the element.

                        background is a shorthand for many other associated properties listed above. One thing to
                        remember
                        is that one of the properties (background-image) can set a gradients as well. That being said
                        background can offer many various things, and one that we will look at is placing a background
                        image. You place an image with using a value of url(url to image) or url("../local/file.png").
                        The
                        shorthand accepts multiple properties like positioning and size, you can even add a
                        background-color. Within the shorthand, order arrangement doesn't matter but it is important to
                        remember when using background-size in the shorthand, it must be included after a potion
                        separated
                        with a forward slash / so an example would be center/cover orcenter/80%.

                        When it comes to designing your web pages, there is a limited set of fonts to use. However
                        instead
                        of buying expensive fonts, you can use google fonts. You embed the link provided by google as
                        well
                        as set the font-family property as google recommends it.
