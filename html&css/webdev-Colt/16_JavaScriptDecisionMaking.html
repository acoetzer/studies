                    <h2 id="">Decision Making With Code</h2>
                    <p>
                        Decision making with code refers to things like, if a user is signed for example, then display
                        this information. If one things equates to a certain value then something should happen. If
                        there are comments, then display comments, or if there are no comments, then display something
                        else instead.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So when talking about decision making in code, it refers to the a logical/conditional statement.

                                <li>'A' > 'a'; <span class="important">false, it's not greater than.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Comparison operators are like the math operators, though they do not perform any mathimatical
                        function like addition. Comparison operators do however compare values. The first 4 comparison
                        operators are fairly self explanatory, they check whether or not a value is <span
                            class="highlight">greater than, less than</span> or even <span class="highlight">less than
                            or equal to</span> and <span class="important">return a boolean value</span> based on the
                        result.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another thing to mention is that, you can, <span class="important">but not recommended</span>,
                        compare 2 strings together. They will return a boolean value of true and false. This is due to
                        <span class="important">Unicode</span>, where each character as a value.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="">Equality: Triple Vs. Double Equals</h3>
                    <p>
                        The last for comparison operators have to do with quality, they check whether or not something
                        has the same value or not. There are 2 sets, <span class="important">Doublt & Triple</span>. The
                        double equals <span class="highligh">== !=</span> Checks for equality of the value, though not
                        for type. An example of this can be is the <sub>numerical</sub> <span class="important">1
                            ==</span> <sub>string</sub> <span class="important">'1';</span>, and the anwser is yes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is because of something called <span class="important">equality weirdness</span>,
                        JavaScript will coerce the values to a common type and usually it <span
                            class="important">coerces to a string type</span>, and therefor it will compare the <span
                            class="important">Unicode</span> values. Though, it becomes a little tricky, because if you
                        had to say, is the <sub>numerical</sub> <span class="important">1 ==</span> <sub>string</sub>
                        <span class="important">'2';</span>, then the answer is false and again we need to look at the
                        Unicode value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, moving to triple equals, which is the preferred method for comparing if something is
                        equal to or not. The triple, or otherwise known as <span class="important">strict</span>
                        equality, check for both value and type. It <span class="important">will not</span> coerce to a
                        common type. <span class="important">always use strict or triple equals!</span>

                    <div class="example">
                        <div>
                            <ul>
                                <li>console.log(1+4, 'HI', true) <span class="important">Method to print in

                                <li>console.warn("THIS IS A WARNING") <span class="important">Warning Message</span>
                                </li>
                                <li>console.error("Error Here") <span class="important">Error Message/span>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <ul>
                                <li>alert("HI THERE!") <span class="important">Will display a popup message for the
                                        user</span></li>
                                <li>promt('what is your fav animal?') <span class="important">Will accept an argument
                                        from the user</span></li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <ul>
                                <li>parseInt(userInput) <span class="important">To turn a string into a number</span>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <P>
                        So <span class="highlight">console</span>, like the Math object has a bunch of properties and
                        methods like <span class="important">console.warn()</span> or <span
                            class="important">console.error()</span>, and one such much method is called <span
                            class="important">console.log()</span>, this is how we can print to the console. Up until
                        now we have been working inside a console, therefor there was no need to use this, although it
                        will still work. However we will see later how we will use this from within a html document
                        using scripts.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        There is another thing we can learn and that is <span class="important">alert()</span> Which
                        displays a popup window for the user. Another is a quick way for now to get user input and that
                        is <span class="important">prompt()</span>, Whatever value someone puts in here will be
                        converted to a string, even its a number. A way we can <span class="important">convert the
                            string to a number</span> is with <span class="important">parseInt(userInput var)</span>.

                    <h2 id="">Running JavaScript from a script</h2>
                    <div class="example">
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                &lt;<span class="important">body</span>&gt; <br>
                                <br>
                                <ul>
                                    &lt;<span class="important">script src="/folder/of/script"</span>&gt;&lt;<span
                                        class="important">/script</span>&gt;
                                </ul>
                                &lt;<span class="important">/body</span>&gt;
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned before we have been working directly inside the console to run simple scripts like
                        1 + 2, though the way we embedd JavaScript into html, is with an element known as &lt;<span
                            class="important">script</span>&gt; so that we can save our code. Script has a opening and
                        closing tag with an <span class="important">attribute</span> known as <span
                            class="important">src=""</span> and inside src, is where you direct html to find the
                        <spanimportant>.js</spanimportant> files.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another thing to keep in mind is although we can place this script in our head element. Its best
                        practice to place scripts at the bottom of the body element. <span class="important">This is
                            done so that we can allow for html elements to load in first.</span>

                                Conditionals

                                        console.log(`Sorry today is ${userInput}. Still not Friday yet!!`) <br>

                        </ul>

                    <p>
                        An if statement is a conditional, although here we just looking soley at the <span
                            class="important">if</span> statement. The basic gist of the condition is that code only
                        runs when a conditional is true. When a condition is met, whatever has been specified to happen
                        will happen. Taking a look at the example above, and soley at the if statement, or first block
                        for if.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are saying the if the variable <span class="highlight">userInput</span> is equal to the
                        string 'monday', then print using console.log a message. If that condintional is met, then it
                        will perform the action of assigned to it, however, if it doesn't and there wasn't anything
                        else, nothing will occur.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="">Else If</h3>
                    <p>
                        This brings us to the else if block. If we want more condintionals or outcomes for the same
                        condition statement, then we can add an else if statement. Looking at the primitive example
                        above, we see that if the condition for the first if statement was not met, then it can move to
                        the next condintional an check whether or not it was met there. Thus, if met, will print and
                        outcome, while if not met, will move over to the next conditional or else if or else.

                        Its important to note that you can have as many else if if you want.

                        Once all else if statements has been used, and the userInput didn't match any of the desired
                        results, you can place a else statement. An else state doesn not come with parenthesis and
                        basically says, well fi your answer or result doesn't match anything we have above then sorry
                        pal, move on.
