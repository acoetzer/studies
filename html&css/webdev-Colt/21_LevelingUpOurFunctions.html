                    <p>
                        Before talking about<span class="important">Function Scopes</span>, understanding that the
                        word<span class="important">scope</span> refers to the <span class="highlight">location</span>
                        or <span class="highlight">visibility</span> of a variable. In other words, it means where the
                        variable is defined dictates where we have access to what variable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Variables that are defined <span class="important">inside a function</span> are <span
                            class="important">scoped</span> to that function. In <span class="highlight">Example
                            1</span>, You see a variable scoped inside a function. This means, you <span
                            class="important">do not</span> have access to the variable outside the function. Unless its
                        a global variable such as in <span class="highlight">Example 2</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When looking looking at <span class="highlight">Example 2</span>, we have the same as before
                        just with a global <span class="important">totalEggs</span> variable defined. The outcome of
                        this example would print out <span class="highlight">6 followed by 0</span>. This is because,
                        even though the function was run first, the varaible scoped to that function had higher priority
                        than the global variable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This however, would not be the case if there was no variable scoped within the function, as in
                        <span class="highlight">Example 3</span>. This shows us that a function can call on its parent
                        varaible, in this case the global variable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This also brings us to another point and that is that a function can update a <span
                            class="important">Global</span> variable, as in <span class="highlight">Example 4</span>. In
                        other words, although variables inside a function are scoped to that function, They can read and
                        update variables from outside its <span class="highlight">bubble</span>.

                    <p>
                        <span class="important">Block Scopes</span> refer to variables placed inside a block of code,
                        such as <span class="important">inside the curly braces</span> of a an <span
                            class="highlight">if statement</span> (which is known as <span
                            class="highlight">conditionals</span>), or a <span class="important">for loop</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Just like <span class="important">Function Scopes</span>, You cannot refer the varaibles inside
                        a <span class="important">block scope</span> from the outside, you can vice versa. Though
                        saying you cannot refer to or call a variable that is inside or scoped to a block of code, is
                        kinda true depending on how you define your variable. Meaning if using <span
                            class="highlight">var</span> to define your variable it will be possible to refer to or call
                        a varaible inside a block scope. However, this is not the case for function scopes when using
                        var. If using let or const, you will not be able to refer to or call a variable scoped inside a
                        block of code.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span class="highlight">Higher Order Functions</span> is a fancy way of saying <span
                            class="important">Functions that work with Function</span>. It comes down to <span
                            class="highlight">two</span> main concepts, <span class="important">Functions that accept
                            other functions as arguments</span> & <span class="important">Functions that return other
                            functions</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We know that a function can be stored as a value, infact JavaScript sees functions as values.
                        So, if a function can be store or passed around, it can be used as an argument to another
                        function. Looking at the <span class="highlight">Example</span> above. We see a function named
                        <span class="important">callTwice</span> that accepts <span class="highlight">one</span>
                        argument, the parameter is named func.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Imagine, <span class="highlight">func</span> is a variable, and whatever function get <span
                            class="highlight">passed</span> to <span class="highlight">callTwice</span>, gets stored
                        inside the <span class="important">func keyword</span>. Then inside the function we execute the
                        variable as we already know that a function can be stored in a variable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When executing the <span class="highlight">callTwice</span> function, you only need to input the
                        function name without the parenthesis. Otherwise this will execute the function first and then
                        pass through the value, which will result in an error.

                        <span class="highlight">Higher Order Functions</span> we saw how we could pass a function as an
                        argument. Here, the <span class="highlight">Second</span> concept of that is <span
                            class="important">returning a function</span>. This is usually known as <span

                    <p>
                        what is a <span class="highlight">Method</span>?. To answer that we need to understand that
                        <span class="important">All Methods are functions but not functions are methods</span>. So a
                        Method, is essentially <span class="important">a function that is given a property name inside
                            an Object</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you think about it, nearly everything in JavaScript is an object, including a string which
                        is wrapped in an object. We can define our own methods by assigning a function to a property
                        inside an object. As the example above.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the example above we see <span class="highlight">grow() {..}</span>, that is known as a
                        shorthand to creating the function, as its so common to do so. The longer way of writing the
                        same function would be like so. <span class="highlight">grow: function () {...}</span>.

                        The keyword <span class="important">this</span> is used to access properties inside methods. An

                            grown by 10cm</span>. The <span class="important">this</span> keyword is referring to the

                    <p>
                        There can be a time when a function is saved or captured to another variable, and the <span

                        user doesnt have internet. You can wrap that code in a <span class="important">try/catch</span>
                        block while still allowing the code to execute without completely stopping everything.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the user requires internet you can catch the error and out something like "Need internet" or
                        "you dont have connection".
