            <h2 id="wic">What is CSS</h2>
            <p>
                CCS allows us to control the style of an HTML page, but first we need the HTML page. CSS stands for
                cascading style sheets and is not a full on programming language, it is a language though to describe
                the visual aspects of our HTML document. Whenever we write CSS, we writing what is known as CSS rules.
                Almost everything you do in CSS follows this basic pattern.
            </p>
            <h3>Generic example</h3>
            <div class="code_examples">
                <ul>
                    <li>selector { <br>
                        property: value; <br>
                        }
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>More real example</h3>
            <div class="code_examples">
                <ul>
                    <li>h1 { <br>
                        color: purple; <br>
                        }
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                Looking at the examples you see that you have something known as selector, for example h1, a property
                being color and a value for the said property. So in the more real example you see all h1 headings,
                which can only be 1, has the text color of purple. However it can become more complicated, you can add
                more properties or a element selector with a attribute selector as well furthuring that.
            </p>
            <h2 id="isc">Including styles correctly</h2>
            <p>
                There are a couple ways to include css styles. You can write styles directly inline with an element,
                however this is never a good idea. An example of that would be <span class="code_examples">&lt;h1
                    style="color:purple"&gt;</span>. Another way is to use the style element which can be placed in the
                head of the HTML document. The last way and highly recommended, is creating a .css file and then link it
                in the HTML document using the link element. An example of a link element would look like this <span
                    class="code_examples">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="app.css"&gt;</span>, where app.css would be
                the app.css file you use for styling your
                document.
            </p>
            <h2 id="cbcp">Color & Background: Color Properties</h2>
            <p>
                The Color property changes the color of the text while background-color property, which as it says will
                change the background color of any given selector, note you also get a property background which can
                change the background color but can do many other things as well.
            </p>
            <h3 id="csrnhc">Color systems: RGB, Named & Hexadecimal colors</h3>
            <p>
                The color property in css has a range of different color units it accepts, such as a name like pink or
                orange, it can also take in hexadecimal values as so #ffffff, note that with hexadecimal if the 3 pairs
                are the same value, you can write it in a shorter manner like this #fff or for example #cc55ee can be
                written like #c5e. CSS also accepts rgb input like so rgb(214,122,127) note values need to be in
                parenthesis as well as hsl colors hsl(30, 100%, 50% , .3). The color property will change the text color
                and not the backgroung.
            </p>
            <h2 id="rosc">Reminder on Semicolons & CSS</h2>
            <p>
                A small reminder that to remember to place your <span class="code_examples"> semicolon ;</span> at the
                end of the <span class="code_examples">property: value;</span> pair like so
            </p>
            <h2 id="ctp">Common text properties</h2>
            <p>
                There are various ways you can style text in CSS, this can range from aligning text to the center of the
                page as so, <span class="code_examples">text-align: center</span>.Earlier when discussing HTML we noted
                that its bad practice to use elements like <span class="code_examples">&lt;b&gt;</span> and to rather
                use CSS, and here is an example of bolding with the font weight porperty <span
                    class="code_examples">font-weight: 100 - 900 </span> or another example is to use words for the font
                weight like so <span class="code_examples">font-weight: thin, normal,bold or bolder</span>. You can go
                as far as placing an underline under the text using the text decoration property <span
                    class="code_examples">text-decoration: plum wavy underline</span> or even just adjust the line
                height or letter spacing like so <span class="code_examples">line-height: 1.2em</span>, <span
                    class="code_examples">letter-spacing: 5px</span>.
            </p>
            <h3 id="fsbwp">Font size basics with pixels</h3>
            <p>
                The font size property has many different scalign or sizing units, however for now this is how you scale
                font size with CSS and the pixel unit <span class="code_examples">font-size: 14px</span>. Most
                developers use another unit which will be discussed later, rather than pixels as pixels have what is
                known as a absolute size while the more preferred unit is relative. An example table below:
            </p>
            <div>
                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Relative</th>
                            <th>Absolute</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>EM</td>
                            <td>PX</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>REM</td>
                            <td>PT</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>VH</td>
                            <td>CM</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>VW</td>
                            <td>IN</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>%</td>
                            <td>MM</td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                    <tfoot>
                        <tr>
                            <td colspan="2">and More!</td>
                            <td></td>
                        </tr>
                    </tfoot>
                </table>
            </div>
            <h3 id="tffp">The font family property</h3>
            <p>
                This is an example of the font family property <span class="code_examples">font-family: Ariel,
                    Helvetica, Sans-serif</span> it is important to note the not all browsers share the same fonts, this
                is also true across operating systems like Windows, Mac and linux. This is why we would set a font
                family, so in case they dont have one specific font, it will fallback to the next available font or font
                family. Later in the course we will learn how to add our own fonts.
