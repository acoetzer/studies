                <h2 id="ues">Universal & Element Selectors</h2>
                <div>
                    <h3 id="gcr">Generic CCS Rule</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>selector { <br>
                            property: value; <br>
                            }
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    There are various ways you can write CSS rules, and remembering the generic CSS rule above, there
                    are various ways to select different elements or the selector, even more
                </p>
                <h3 id="us">Universal Selector</h3>
                <div>
                    <h4>Universal Selector Example</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>* { <br>
                            property: value; <br>
                            }
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The universal selector is represented with a * (asterix) symbol and this selects everything in your
                    HTML document for styling. Side note, It will try and style images as well and if you add the color
                    property to it as an example, it will try to style it as well even though it can't.
                </p>
                <h3 id="us">Element Selector</h3>
                <div>
                    <h4>Element Selector Examples</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>button { <br>
                            property: value; <br>
                            }
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>h1,h2 { <br>
                            property: value <br>
                            }
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Above we have 2 examples of element selectors. The first example with the button element,
                    illustrates that all buttons on the HTML page will follow that css rule. While the second example
                    indicates that you can style more than one element selector by separating selectors with a comma.
                    The second example means, all h1 elements and all h2 elements to follow said css rule.
                </p>
                <h3 id="tis">The ID Selector</h3>
                <div>
                    <h4>ID Selector Example</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>#search { <br>
                            property: value; <br>
                            }
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    We know that in HTML we can give certain elements an ID attribute to link things like headings to an
                    input as an example. Though ids' can also be used by elements as a form of a hook to style elements.
                    We can then make a css rule using a # (hash) symbol for the ID hook followed by the id name, as the
                    example above to style a particular element. This is not to say that you should use a bunch of id's
                    to style your HTML document. In fact this is not good practice and should be avoided, try to keep
                    the amount of id's on a page to a minimum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are other selectors which are more suitable, like the class attribute/selector below.
                </p>
                <h3 id="tcs">The Class Selector</h3>
                <div>
                    <h4>Class Selector Example</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>.tags { <br>
                            property: value; <br>
                            }
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Here you can already see the difference between the id selector and class. We use the . (period)
                    symbol followed by the class name to indicate we selecting a class attribrute in CSS. As mentioned
                    above its not best practice to use a bunch of id attributes to style your page as id's are meant to
                    be unique. So you cannot give multiple element the same id to multiple elements and hope to style 10
                    things at once. However you can do so with the class attribute. An ample of this is if you have
                    multiple tags on your page and they should all have the same style, you can give them the same
                    class="tags" and then make a rule as shown above.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is why using classes is the more preferred method and most commonly used among developers.
                </p>
                <h3 id="tds">The Decendant Selector</h3>
                <div>
                    <h4>Decendant Selector Example</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>li a { <br>
                            property: value; <br>
                            }
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The decendant selector is written with a space, so in the example above we have li (space) a. This
                    is saying that we want to style all anchor tags that are nested within a list element. The anchor
                    tag just has to be somewhere inside the list, doesnt have to be directly after a list element, it
                    just needs to be nested somewhere within the list element.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Side note, the list will not be affect or anything else inside the list will not be affect, as an
                    example, if you had a list then header and then anchor tag, it will not affect the list or header.
                </p>
                <h3 id="tadcs">The Adjacent & Direct Child Selector</h3>
                <h4>These are not very common to use!</h4>
                <div>
                    <h4>Adjacent Selector Example</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>h1 + p { <br>
                            property: value; <br>
                            }
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The adjacent selector or combinator is written with a + (plus) symbol. This means that it will
                    affect only the elements proceeding the first selector. So in the example above, only paragraphs
                    that proceed after a h1 heading. Not the headings themselves.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h4>Direct Child/Decendant Selector Example</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>div > li { <br>
                            property: value; <br>
                            }
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The direct child or decendant is written with a > (greater than) symbol. Looking at the example
                    above, this means that any list element that is nested directly after a div element will be styled.
                </p>
                <h3 id="tas">The Attribute Selector</h3>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>input[type="password"] { <br>
                            property: value; <br>
                            }
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The attribute selector is written with [] (square brackets). You can select based off of attributes,
                    as the example above, you can select an input with a type set to password. You can also go as far as
                    typing [class="post"]. Imagine you had multiple classes with post but you only want to style
                    sections with the class post and not anything else.
                </p>
                <h3 id="pc">Pseudo Classes</h3>
                <div>
                    <h4>Pseudo Classes Example</h4>
                    <ul>

                                    }
                                </li>

                    Pseudo Classes are like modifiers, they keywords we add on to the end of a selector that specify a particular state of that element. This how we can target checkbox's that have been checked
