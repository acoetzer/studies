# OSI and TCPIP Model
## Open Systems Interconnection and Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol
* How many layers are in networking?
    * what are they and why are they important?
* Below show a depictition of what is know as the OSI and or TCP/IP Model system.

* The OSi Model and TCP/IP Model are taking what is known as a Protocol Stack and neatly organising them on there own layer.
    * Note that its not always as clear cut as what the image above makes it seem, especially in the OSI or Open System Interconnection model makes it seem.
* Getting to why we have models, is because we taking complex problems and breaking them up into small pieces.
* The layers we as networking people concentrate on are the lower 4 layers, or otherwise known as
    * Transport
    * Network
    * Data Link
    * Physical
* Note that the TCP/IP Model is the more realistic model now a days, though looking at the OSI and TCP/IP models, you will notice that the TCP/IP Model combines layers 5 to 7 as Applications however it is still known as Layer 7 even though the TCP/IP Model only has 5 Layers.
    * This is partly due to convention but also because the combining the OSI model into the TCP/IP model.
* So reittereating as networkers we focus on the first 4 layers and then layer 7 which is the combined applications layer.

## What Protocols Reside In Which Layer?

## Bits, Frames, Packets, Segments and More

* There is some terms when it comes to talking about "stuff" on specific layers in the TCP/IP Model shown in the image below.

## Bits
* When sending data on the physical layer, we sending 0s and 1s known as **_Bits_**. 
        * So the bits of data on a fiber cable is represented as light. 
            * --> If there is light its a 1 if there is no light its a 0, 
        * Whereas the bits of data on a copper cable is represented as electricity.
            * --> If there is electricity then its a 1, If there is no electricity then its a 0
        * so 0s and 1s would represent our bits, or binary values.
