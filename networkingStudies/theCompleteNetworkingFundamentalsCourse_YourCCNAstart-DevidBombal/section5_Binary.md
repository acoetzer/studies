# Binary Introduction 
* Binary is a building block in networks today. Its used in multiple places such as:
    * Access Lists or Access Control Lists
        * which allow you to permit or deny various devices on your network.
        * You do this by matching specific ip addresses by their binary number.
    * Supnetting, or supnet mask.

## What Is A Binary Number
* We learn that a Binary Number is part of the base 2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which is essentially a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols 1 or 0 where we use the base 10 number system. 
    * This in computer electronics equates to devices having 2 states, on or off, though in binary on is 1 and off is 0.
* Each Bit has 2 States and that bit is then used as an exponent against the 2 states giving us the result of a decimal number which equates to the amount of combinations that that bit has.

# Binary Math

* 2 x 1 <sup>2<sup>1</sup></sup> = Decimal Number 2 and amount of Combinations which is either 1 or 0

<br>

![binaryMath2Bits](./src/binaryMath2Bits.png)

* 2 x 2 <sup>2<sup>2</sup></sup> = Decimal Number 4 and amount of Combinations

<br>

![binaryMath3Bits](./src/binaryMath3Bits.png)

* 2 x 3 <sup>2<sup>3</sup></sup> = Decimal Number 8 and amount of Combinations

<br>

![binaryMath4Bits](./src/binaryMath4Bits.png)

* 2 x 4 <sup>2<sup>4</sup></sup> = Decimal Number 16 and amount of Combinations

<br>

* 2 to the power of 0 <sup>2<sup>0</sup></sup> = 1
* 2 to the power of 1 <sup>2<sup>1</sup></sup>
    * which is 2 multiplied together 1 time <sup>2x1</sup> = 2 Bits
* 2 to the power of 2 <sup>2<sup>2</sup></sup>
    * which is 2 multiplied together 2 times <sup>2x2</sup> = 4 Bits
* 2 to the power of 3 **<sup>2<sup>3</sup></sup>**
    * which is 2 multiplied together 3 times <sup>2x2x2</sup> = 8 Bits
* 2 to the power of 4 <sup>2<sup>4</sup></sup>
    * which is 2 multiplied together 4 time <sup>2x2x2x2</sup> = 16 Bits
* 2 to the power of 5 <sup>2<sup>5</sup></sup>
    * which is 2 multiplied together 5 time <sup>2x2x2x2x2</sup> = 32 Bits
* 2 to the power of 6 <sup>2<sup>6</sup></sup>
    * which is 2 multiplied together 6 time <sup>2x2x2x2x2x2</sup> = 64 Bits
* 2 to the power of 7 <sup>2<sup>7</sup></sup>
    * which is 2 multiplied together 7 time <sup>2x2x2x2x2x2x2</sup> = 128 Bits
* 2 to the power of 8 <sup>2<sup>8</sup></sup>
    * which is 2 multiplied together 8 time <sup>2x2x2x2x2x2x2x2</sup> = 256 Bits
