            <h2><b>Introduction to HTML</b></h2>
            <p>
                Taking a look at this saying, the <b>Purple Dino Danced</b>. We can break down what HTML is compared to
                and
                how to explain what HTML is. HTML is the <b>'what'</b>in this sentence, in otherwords the dino, whereas
                the
                purple is css and danced is js. HTML is what is being displayed or viewed, so the in short its the
                <b>what</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML is known as a markup language and stands for <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b>. It is not a full
                blown
                programming language with complex logic, It's a way to mark up a document <i>(plain text)</i> and have a
                way
                to indicate what is <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i> or what is a <b><a
                        href="https://www.google.com">link</a></b>
                as an example, through what is known as elements or HTML elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                To write HTML we use what is know as HTML elements, as exmaple:
            <ul>
                <li><b>&lt;p&gt;</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>This represents the paragraph element</i></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>&lt;h1&gt;</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>This represents the main header on the page</i></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>&lt;img&gt;</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>This embeds an image</i></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>&lt;form&gt;</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i>This represents a form</i></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            These are some of the elements used to write HTML. Although above doesn't illustrate this, but we generally
            wrap
            some form of content with what is knowns as &lt;opening tag&gt; and a &lt;/closing tag&gt;.
            </p>
            <p>
                An example would be something like this &lt;h1&gt;This is a header&lt;/h1&gt; to represent the start and
                end
                of the main header. You can also nest tags within elements, using the same example as before, you can
                make
                the header bold, like so &lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is a header in bold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;.
            </p>
            <!-- sub-heading - paragraph elements -->
            <h3><b>Paragraph Elements</b></h3>
            <p>
                The first element we look at is the &lt;p&gt; for paragraph, and this doesn't mean its only for text
                purposes, you can have a paragraph for things you wish to group together. That could be a paragraph of
                images or different pieces of a form. However for now we are only focused on textual paragraphs.
